## Demo

BFLoadingView is a nice morphing poligonal activity indicator designed as an animating HUD. Try to add it to your `UIViewController` and you should get the following result:

### Use it!

First you have to import the BFLoadingView Library by adding `import BFLoadingView`.

Then call the following when you want to show the animated activity indicator. The fade in duration is 0.25 seconds:
```swift
showLoadingView()
```

But yeah, you can also set colors. How about this:
```swift
showLoadingView(backgroundColor: .red, triangle1Color: .black, triangle2Color: .blue, viewBackgroundColor: .yellow)
```

When you are done with your task in code you can also hide the indicator again by the following function:
```swift
hideLoadingView()
```

That's it. Have fun!
